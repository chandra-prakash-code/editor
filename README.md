**Numbas** is an open-source system for creating SCORM-compliant exams which
run entirely in the browser, developed by [Newcastle University's School of
Mathematics, Statistics and Physics](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/).

This is the Numbas editor. The Numbas runtime can be found at http://github.com/numbas/Numbas.

For more information, see [the Numbas website](http://www.numbas.org.uk).

### Installation

Instructions for installation can be found at http://numbas.github.io/editor/.

You probably don't need to set up your own editor installation: there's [a free public editor at **math**centre](http://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk), which is supported by Newcastle University.
